# Model IT2FLS TSK
Interval-Type Fuzzy Logic System with Takagi-Sugeno model optimized with heuristic.

Script runs Genetic Algorithm for given parameters, then verifies the best set of parameters on test set.
Input Intercal-Type-2 fuzzy functions are optimized.
Validated on 20% of data - Accuracy 100%
 with genetic_algorithm(fitness_func=ff, genotype_size=9, generation_size=30, generations=20, debug=True)
